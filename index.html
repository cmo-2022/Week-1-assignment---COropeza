           <blockquote>
            The Mission of the St. Augustine Catholic Church Women's Guild is to serve the needs of the parish family by supporting the work of its many ministries and to serve the surrounding community while enhancing spiritual growth and fellowship among its members. In addition to its service to the parish, the Guild strives to reach out to women and children in need through specific programs and projects in conjunction with parish ministries and other worthy activities not served by those ministries. The St. Augustine Catholic Church Women's Guild is open to all women of the Parish.
            Join us the second Wednesday of each month, October through April.
